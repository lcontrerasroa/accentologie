    <h1>Transcript: Smartypants Presentation</h1>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Thanks to all of you for attending my talk. My <span class="highlight-pink">presentation</span> is called, <span class="highlight-pink">God's</span> Mistakes: How I Would Make Our Bodies Better.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Rekha:</span> Yes.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> If we're being honest and we look inward, we can acknowledge, our bodies are weak, our bodies are fragile, and our bodies are a <span class="highlight-pink">little</span> <span class="highlight-pink">disgusting</span>. And I think that if we put our heads together we can strive for something even greater. Here are some of my suggestions. By a show of hands, who <span class="highlight-pink">here</span> knows the most dreams they've ever had in a single night? Who knows the total number of gallons they've ever peed? Rekha, do you know?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Rekha:</span> Why are you pointing at me?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Me neither. But with my stat tracker you would have all these analytics at your fingertips in a convenient, easy to read display across your back. Now, how does this benefit us? Well, for one thing, <span class="highlight-pink">compare</span> with friends. Let's say you meet somebody and you think, I have nothing in common with this <span class="highlight-pink">person</span>. But then you learn you and them have the exact <span class="highlight-pink">same</span> <span class="highlight-pink">number</span> of <span class="highlight-pink">white</span> blood cells. Instant bond. Most exciting of all, new world records.</p>
    <p>(Laughter)</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> There is somebody out there in the world right now who has swallowed the most number of times out of anyone on the planet. And they don't know. It's Grant. Just say it's Grant.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Rekha:</span> It's a runaway, Grant!</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> There is somebody out there who has the highest daily <span class="highlight-pink">fart</span> average in the world and they don't know.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Rekha:</span> I'd know.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> But now the <span class="highlight-pink">ordinary</span> would become extraordinary. And the Guinness Book of World Records would be that much bigger. Moving on, who has ever seen something that they didn't wanna look at?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Ugh!</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> 100%, yeah. But evolution has gifted us a way to deal with that. A classic technique. So I say, let us <span class="highlight-pink">turn</span> off the other senses as well. In the same way that you can look at something and say, I don't wanna see that no <span class="highlight-pink">more</span>, and you <span class="highlight-pink">close</span> your eyes. If there's a bad smell you should be able to simply turn your nose off.</p>
    <p>(Audience reaction)</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> If you have a feeling that you don't like, you can just turn your sense of touch off. You know that dish that your nana makes that you hate the taste of? What is it? Eggplant parm?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Rekha:</span> My grandmother, yes.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Well now you can eat it and <span class="highlight-pink">smile</span> and she would never know that your taste buds had been turned right off. Finally, there's a sound playing at da club and you don't like it. You just simply close those ears right up, now.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> It's like a skip button for your ears.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Next, right now many of us in this room have millions, billions, even trillions of these tiny bugs <span class="highlight-pink">squirming</span> and swarming. So I started thinking about this, and I <span class="highlight-pink">realized</span> there's gotta be a better way. Well, first of all, it's a number's <span class="highlight-pink">game</span>. That's why we do it. Okay, our bodies make trillions of these disgusting bugs because it wants to hedge its bets that one of them will be healthy and <span class="highlight-pink">viable</span> and create a new life, okay?</p>
   

 <!-- <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Of course.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> But why work harder when you can work smarter? I propose that our bodies instead put our energies towards making one perfect huge sperm. It would be flawless every time. It would be roughly the size of a small worm. We can call it a spworm.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> A small worm? A spworm? Or a small snake, kind of.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> And it would kind of writhe around and flap, like when you catch a fish and it's on the boat and it's just kind of like...</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Why does it have to do that?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> You don't have to worry, it will still be wet, that's still part of it.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> I wasn't worried. We have different desires.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> It would be covered in fluid, that's still part of it. Let me explain why this is an improvement. Now, first of all, I don't mean to brag, but I am gay. And I know that I'm speaking from a position of privilege, but I, personally, have never had to worry about a pregnancy scare. But I know that many people out there have. But with the spworm, you wouldn't have a pregnancy scare ever again. You could rest assured, with certainty, that the spworm had been fished out and disposed of.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Wait. Out of what? Where is it? In the grass. Are dick holes still the same size?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> It would die in a matter of minutes.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Oh my god! Minutes is a long time!</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Toss it in the thing, turn on the garbage disposal. I see some people nodding.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Who? Who is nodding?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> I'm also a queer man, so I understand. Right. Now, I was just kidding about that last section. So if you were nodding in agreement, just know that I am judging you, and I do think that was disgusting. But the point that I was trying to make was, how nice would it have been to turn off your ears?</p>
    <p>(Applause)</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Moving on. If we had a see-through panel on our chest that displayed all of our organs, it would be a huge improvement for many reasons. For one thing, compare with friends. Not everything has to be gamified, Paul.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> The first one every time!</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Anyone here friends with Paul? What's it like outside of Smarty Pants?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Like, really, really good.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Who's taller? Who's shoe sizes are bigger? How big is your hand compared to my hand? I'm so sick of those already. I need new things to compare. Now we can look at each other's chest cavity and see who has a better tint of blood. Whose texture on their kidney is cooler? Next, this would make diagnoses very easy for doctors. You would no longer have to be exposed to harmful X-rays. Lastly, it would create an opportunity for new and cool kinks. You could have the hottest, most honkin', big old gallbladder in the world.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> But you would have muscle fat, you know, like fascia in between that and the organ.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> No, you wouldn't.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Fascia fashion!</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> I'm the one designing this thing, you wouldn't.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Uh, shirts. Is that existing in this world?</p>
    <p><span class="character">Presenter:</span> Well, they'd be covered up most of the time, but you would want to compare with friends, so you would take it off.</p>
    <p><span class="character">Audience:</span> Compare with friends!</p>
